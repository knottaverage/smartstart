  <h1>About Smart Start Tutoring</h1>
  <p>Your child is an individual. Before we recommend a specific tutor or
    tutoring program for your child, we will confer with you and decide on the
    best strategy and method to assist your child.</p>
  <p>Each student will have a profile that is designed to consider his/her
    unique learning style, abilities and specific needs.</p>
  <p>Together we will agree on goals and objectives for your child. Smart Start
    Tutoring will provide individual attention to your child in a one-on-one
    tutoring session.</p>
  <p>Your child’s academic needs will be addressed in a positive, constructive
    manner with success as the main focus. This achievement will help to
    improve and enhance your child’s self esteem and academic outlook.</p>
